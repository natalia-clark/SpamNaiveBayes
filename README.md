# Spam Detection using basic Natural Language Processing and Naive Bayes
A simple implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify spam.
---
# Goal:
- Understand how to properly clean text for NLP involving stemming, lemmatization, removing stopwords, etc.
- Understand Naive Bayes' approach to classification and shortcoming

# Potential Improvements:
- customized stopwords based on the dataset to better understand the problem (however, perhaps taking away the re-deployability of the model)
- Add the model to a pipeline to streamline processing and rerun on a new dataset to check confusion matrix

Note: Code outline provided by Professor Alvaro José Méndez López of IE University in Madrid. It was a guided exercise to understand the basic process of NLP as applied to a given dataset. Implementation carried out by me.
